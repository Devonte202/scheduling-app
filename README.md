### Submitting a Pull Request
- Create a branch off of the main branch, the name of said branch must begin with SCHDL and end with the number of the issue being worked on. (ex. SCHDL-3)
- When creating a pull request, the title must begin with the branch name and include a short description of what the issue the PR solves is.
- Ensure you add a description for every pr to explain the changes you made to make for an easy code review process.
- When merging a pull request, make sure to squash and merge to make it easier to revert that pull request at any time!
